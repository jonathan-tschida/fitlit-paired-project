# Overview

Paired project during Mod 2 at Turing School of Software. We had 8 days to complete this project. We created classes and connected their methods to be displayed on the DOM. We used classes and array prototypes to manipulate an extensive database of users. We used Mocha and Chai for the TDD, HTML, CSS, and ES6 JavaScript.
